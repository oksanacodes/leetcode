Runtime Complexity is 2^n - exponential
Each fibonacii functin invokes 2 recorsive functions. Therefore total time taken to compute nth number of fibonacci sequence is O(2^n).

 Space Complexity is O(nm) where n is the max depth of the recursion tree
  If each function call of recursive algorithm takes O(m) space and if the maximum depth of recursion tree is 'n'
  then space complexity of recursive algorithm would be O(nm). Depth is the path from the root node in recursion tree to that leaf node.
