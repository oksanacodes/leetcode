# DFS
the depth-first search algorithm is mainly used to:
1. Traverse all vertices in a “graph”; 
2. Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a “graph”.

Time Complexity: O(V+E). 
Here, V represents the number of vertices, and E represents the number of edges. 
We need to check every vertex and traverse through every edge in the graph.

Space Complexity: O(V). 
Either the manually created stack or the recursive call stack can store up to V vertices.
